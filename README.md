# Defend My Food

## Background and Overview

Defend My Food is a game inspired by the tower defense game where you must place pieces of your on board to defend the swarm of "bad guys" from getting your food. 


## Functionality and MVPs

In Defend my Food, the user must place his pieces on the board with a drag'n drop functionality. The user must place them in an are where they feel would be best to defend their food. When a bad guy comes within a 125px distance of the users piece on either side, the piece will start to shoot towards the bad guy. After being hit by 3 shots, the bad guy will be destroyed and evaporate.
